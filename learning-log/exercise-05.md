## Exercise 05 – Aggregation on Nested Fields

### Business Question
Which country has the highest number of registered users?

### What I practiced
- Grouping by nested object fields
- Sorting aggregated results
- Limiting output to top result

### Key Learning
- MongoDB can aggregate deeply nested fields directly
- `$sort` + `$limit` is a common ranking pattern

### Backend Insight
Country-based analytics are frequently used in
dashboards, reports, and growth analysis.
